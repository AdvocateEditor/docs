# Collections

## A place to group your spaces

A collection in GitBook is kind of like a folder for your spaces or other collections. When you create a collection, you'll get a kind of ‘tree’ view in your sidebar.

This makes it super easy to collect all your content into logical groups and can have a big impact on your GitBook experience!

## Going further with collections

We're just touching on the basics here, but if you want to get extra fancy, collections can actually be published and have their very own set of permissions! Feel free to go explore, but for now, let's have a peek at the GitBook editor.
